# Dimensionality Reduction Comparison
🎯 Project: Visual Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in R

This repository contains a practical exercise in dimensionality reduction, where five methods are applied and compared visually on the same dataset:

  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - Isometric Mapping (Isomap)
  - UMAP (Euclidean distance)
  - UMAP (Manhattan distance)

The goal is to evaluate how different algorithms project high-dimensional data into 2D space and whether these representations preserve meaningful relationships such as class separation.
This project is for learning purposes and not part of any thesis or publication.
