# README.MD - Self_learning_projects
This repository contains a collection of self-learning projects I developed to improve my skills in:
  - Bioinformatics
  - Machine Learning
  - Data Science
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Dimensionality Reduction
  - Visualization in R and Python
  
These projects are not part of my academic work. They represent personal exploration, curiosity, and continuous learning.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

  - Explore key analytical techniques used in biomedical research.
  - Strengthen my coding skills in R, Python, and common bioinformatics workflows.
  - Practice preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and interpretation.
  - Share reproducible examples with future collaborators and employers.

🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning space, but suggestions are welcome.
Feel free to open an issue or contact me.
